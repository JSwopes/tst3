# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



package.json
The package.json file is a critical configuration file in Node.js projects. It serves several important purposes:

    Metadata: It contains metadata about the project, including the project name, version, description, author, and license. This information is useful for identifying and documenting the project.

    Dependencies: It lists the project's dependencies, both runtime dependencies (dependencies required to run the application) and development dependencies (dependencies used during development, testing, or building). These dependencies are typically installed using a package manager like npm or Yarn.

    Scripts: It defines custom scripts that can be executed using npm or Yarn commands. These scripts are useful for running tasks like starting the application, running tests, building the project, and more.

    Configuration: It can include various configuration settings for your project or tools you are using. For example, you can configure ESLint, Babel, or other tools in your package.json file.

    Version Control: It allows you to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control (e.g., in a .gitignore file) and which should be included. This is useful for specifying what should be part of the project's source code and what should not.




package-lock.json
The package-lock.json file is used in Node.js projects to lock down and maintain the exact version of each package dependency installed in your project. It serves the following purposes:
    Dependency Version Control: It records the specific version of each package dependency and its sub-dependencies used in your project. This ensures that all collaborators and build environments have the same dependency versions, reducing the likelihood of compatibility issues.

    Deterministic Builds: It guarantees that every time you run npm install or yarn install, you get the exact same set of dependency versions, making your project's builds deterministic and reproducible.

    Faster Installations: By specifying exact versions, it speeds up the installation process since package managers can avoid unnecessary updates and calculations.

    Security: It can improve security by ensuring that you are not accidentally using a package with known vulnerabilities, as long as you keep your dependencies up-to-date.
